# Lambda-CDA-Model
This project is based on constraining expainding universe.
Our am is model how universe evolve with time from observational dat.
in this project we have solve the Einstein equation of general theory relativity (Coupled differential equation), particularly I have see the variation of densty (matter, radiation, dark energy) with scale factor.
This tell us how universe evolve.
